# Fetch-Api-Data
In this project, I've fetched the user's data from https://dummyapi.io/  and stored inside the database.

I've used python and couple of it's libraries such as requests library in order to get data from api and mysql-connector library so that we can connect to our database through python, and finally saved sql data into csv format using pandas library.
